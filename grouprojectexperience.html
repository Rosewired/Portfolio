          <u>Snake in Elm:</u>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This assignment was completed for the Spring 2017 Programming Languages course. This was a group assignment, completed by myself and one other student, with the aim of using a then unfamiliar language (Elm) and functional programming to create an interactive program with graphical elements. For our project, we chose to recreate the game of Snake in the Elm language. This game is very simple, involving moving around a console and eating cherries while trying to avoid going out of bounds or eating your own tail.

	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To facilitate group work, my partner and I made use of Github, which allowed us to upload and share code in real time. We successfully completed this project over the course of three weeks, which was perhaps the shortest amount of time I had over the course of my college experience to create a software application. However, the fact that there were two of us working simultaneously resulted in project quality comparable to that of my Solo Project Experience assignment (which was developed over the course of two months).
