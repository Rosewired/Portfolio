          <u>Granite Connections Learning Lab Database:</u>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This interface (and underlying database) was written for the Fall 2015 Introduction to Database Systems course. For this project, we were to construct a database and UI for an organization of our choice - as a result, this project was completed with the Granite Connections Learning Lab (where recovery credit is given in the form of packets) in mind as a client. At the time, the Learning Lab found itself struggling with compiling student records into a single location accessible by any educator. This resulted in a database containing basic student and recovery packet information that is available based on log in credentials.

          <br>
	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the requirements of this assignment, I was able to learn a variety of valuable skills such as HTML, CSS, and MySQL. I also began to learn the basic methodology of software design for a specific client. The final result was a simple, but user-friendly interface where a variety of credit-recovery records could be stored and accessed by any advisor.
