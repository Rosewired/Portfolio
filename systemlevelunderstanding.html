        <h3>System Level Understanding</h3>
        <p>
	 <u>Dining Philosophers:</u>
         <br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project, called Dining Philosophers, was written for a lab on Java concurrency in the Spring 2016 Operating Systems course. The goal of this assignment was to design threads such that 5 philosophers will alternately think and eat, but no two philosophers may eat at the same time. This must be done in such a way that prevents a deadlock, which is a system state in which no progress is possible.
         <br>
         <br>
	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The solving of the Dining Philosophers problem represents an understanding of the deeper mechanisms of process management within an operating system, as well as comprehension of server vs. client interactions. I feel that this is an important demonstration of system-level understanding, as threading and locking are vital to creating applications that run as efficiently as possible.
