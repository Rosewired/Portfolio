        <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
        <p>
          <u>Cheapest Path:</u>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This assignment was completed as a lab for the Fall 2015 Algorithms and Data Structures course. The aim of the lab was to compare two Cheapest Path algorithms: the greedy algorithm, and dynamic programming. It was up to us to implement these algorithmic solutions to be used in a simple GUI (provided).
          <br>
          <br>
	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solving the problem meant minimizing the cost in traveling from the leftmost column of the GUI to the rightmost column (while moving either diagonally or immediately to the right). Upon completion of this assignment, I had demonstrated an understanding of dynamic programming solutions, which involve problem solving via breaking down a larger problem into smaller problems, solving those smaller problems, and then using the results to solve the larger problem. This is just one of the many algorithmic problem solving methods I learned in this course, which taught such algorithms as those involved with closest-pair problems, red-black trees, and knapsack problems.
