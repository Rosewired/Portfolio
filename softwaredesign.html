	 <u>Pig Game:</u>
         <br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this project (completed in the Fall 2014 Intro to Computer Science course), we were presented with a Java GUI and a collection of skeleton classes, and were tasked with completing these classes to create a rendition of the game of Pig. We were also required to implement a basic strategy AI for the computer opponent once the game itself was working.
         <br>
         <br>
	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This work demonstrates an understanding of object oriented programming, as well as the applications of inheritance between classes. Abstract classes, variable scope, and differentiating between static and non-static variables were also important concepts to this assignment. This project is what I consider to be my first true piece of software - it required rigorous design and testing in order to achieve a polished finished product. However, as this was my first software design project, this assignment is best when compared with “Nano-ventures: The Adventure’s Starting”, which can be found under Other Works. Said assignment is a more recent representation of my software development skills, and also features object oriented programming and inheritance.
