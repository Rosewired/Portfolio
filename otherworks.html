	 <u>Westminster College Senior Capstone Project:</u>
         <br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of the Senior Capstone Project was to create a significant, 4+ month long representation of my work as an undergraduate computer science major. It was to be seen as an opportunity to learn a new skill or technology. As such, I chose to demonstrate my passion for video games and video game development via a Python-based RPG. I supplemented the Python language (which I was not terribly familiar with before completing this project) with the Doryen library (aka libtcod) and the Pygame library.

	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the game, titled “Nano-ventures: The Adventure’s Starting” you take the role of Reinald, an adventurer living in a small town. You awaken one morning to find that a demon trapped in the town’s mountain is escaping, and must then go on a 16x16 pixel adventure to save the town. The game features a full story with 4 linear dungeons, a randomly generated farming dungeon, 25 spells, an interactive town, original graphics and sound, and much more.

	 <u>CMPT 322 (Software Engineering) Final Project:</u>
         <br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project, named Space Spellers, was the product of JBEXsoftware, a fictional development group created for Westminster’s Spring 2016 Software Engineering course. The group consisted of myself and three other students (as well as an outsite graphic designer), and the goal of our project was to create an educational spelling game for a fictional school district. This was done through simulated Agile methodology within the class, which was taught by a software development manager from Sample Minded. This created a professional and realistic environment. 
        <br>
        <br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this project, my focus was on the HTML and CSS for a main dashboard, student page, and teacher page. Each page had to have a different flair to suit a different audience, resulting in a space theme for student pages and a simple, easy to view theme for the teacher page. The end product was a web page that could be logged into and would automatically redirect based on whether the credentials are that of a teacher or student. A teacher is taken to a database of their students, while a student is taken to a spaceship dashboard where they may then click to play the game. The goal of the game, meanwhile, is to pilot a spaceship and shoot asteroids with incorrectly spelled words.
